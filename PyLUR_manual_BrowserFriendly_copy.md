PyLUR Wizard
================
v.2019-10-11

Installation
============

System requirements: Windows 10, ArcGIS Pro v2.2.4 or higher

The PyLUR tools require a small number of additional Python packages to be installed. In ArcGIS Pro this can be done using the Python Package Manager. Follow these steps to install additional Python packages:

1.  Open ArcGIS Pro. Click the About ArcGIS Pro button in the bottom left corner (denoted by the red arrow in the screenshot below). *In ArcGIS Pro v.2.3 this button is called Settings.*

![](Images\manager1.jpg)

1.  In the menu on the left hand side click Python. This will open the Python Package Manager. Click the Manage Environments button.

![](Images\manager2a.jpg)

1.  This will open the Manage Environments window. Since additional packages cannot be installed in the default environment, you will need to clone the default environment. Ensure that the default environment is selected (this is typically called 'arcgispro-py3'), then click clone.

![](Images\manager3.jpg)

Creating the cloned environment may take a while, a blue line at the bottom of the window indicates that the process is still running. Once the clone has been created, click the radio button to make it the active environment. Click Close, then Exit ArcGIS Pro and restart it for the changes to take effect.

![](Images\manager3_1.jpg)

1.  Restart ArcGIS Pro, click on About ArcGIS Pro, then click on Python in the menu on the left hand side. Under Project Environment you should see the name of the cloned environment. *If you do not see the name of the cloned environment, repeat step 3 being careful not to exit the programme until the clone has been created.* Click Add Packages.

![](Images\manager4.jpg)

This opens the Add Packages interface. In the Search box type patsy. The patsy package should appear in the list below. Select the patsy package and click Install.

![](Images\manager4a.jpg)

This will open the Install Package window. Tick the box in the bottom left to agree to the terms and conditions, then click Install.

![](Images\manager4b.jpg)

The installation may take a while. Once the installation is finished, the list underneath Add Packages will refresh. If you scroll down the list, you will see that patsy is no longer on it (because it has been installed). If you want to check that the package has been installed, click on Installed Packages. If you scroll down the list of installed packages, patsy should be listed.

1.  Repeat step 4 for the following packages:

-   statsmodels

![](Images\manager4c.jpg)

-   seaborn

![](Images\manager4d.jpg)

-   wxpython

![](Images\manager4e.jpg)

After these four packages have been installed, click the back arrow in the menu on the left hand side.

1.  Click Open another project, browse to the PyLUR.aprx ArcGIS Pro Project file and double-click to open it. The PyLUR.aprx file can be found in the PyLUR folder in the PyLUR repository. In the Catalog window double-click Toolboxes, then double-click PyLUR.tbx. This will open the PyLUR toolbox, which contains the BuildLUR and ApplyLUR scripts. Running either of these script will open the Build LUR or Apply LUR wizard, respectively.

General Information
===================

What is LUR?
------------

Land use regression (LUR) is a statistical method, which uses geospatial data to develop prediction models in environmental sciences. It is predominantly used in air pollution research to predict pollutant concentrations empirically within a given a study area. However, it has also been used for other environmental phenomena such as noise, air temperature and water microbiology.

The underlying principle of LUR is that a measured quantity (e.g. pollutant concentration, noise level, temperature etc) at a given location depends on characteristics of the surrounding environment, in particular on the presence and absence of sources and sinks, which increase and decrease values respectively.

LUR models are developed by using measured data from a number of monitoring sites as the dependent variable and data on the surrounding environment extracted as predictor variables in a multiple linear regression analysis. For example, in an air pollution study particulate matter concentrations might be measured at fifty monitoring sites. Then for each monitoring site potential predictor variables are extracted such as the area of industrial land use around the monitoring site, the distance to the nearest road, the number of motor vehicles on the nearest road etc. The particulate matter concentrations and the potential predictors are entered into a supervised machine learning process, which will try to construct a parsimonious multiple linear regression model. This model can then be used to predict particulate matter concentrations at any point within the study area.

Hybrid models can also be developed. In the PyLUR tool a hybrid model is a model in which one or more mandatory variables are selected by the user. These mandatory variables are forced into the model, regardless of the amount of variance that they explain or their direction of effect. An example of this would be using the output from dispersion models run at a coarse spatial resolution as a mandatory variable, which could add a measure of global variability to the measures of local variability used in LUR.

The PyLUR Wizard
----------------

The PyLUR wizard guides the user through building and applying LUR models from within the ArcGIS software. The user must complete each input field in the wizard starting at the top of the page and then moving downwards. The statusbar at the bottom of wizard indicates if an input field is ready for an entry or if it is currently being processed. *Some inputs may take a while to be processed.* Once an input has been completed a green tick mark will appear next to it. Clicking on the question mark button next to each section heading will open a help window with further information on how to complete each section. The user may exit the wizard at any time by clicking on the Cancel button; however, all progress made in the wizard will be lost.

The wizard window can be resized by dragging the sides or by clicking on the maximise button in the title bar.

![](Images\wizard_features.png)

There are three types of windows that may appear during the process of completing the wizard.

### Information Windows

![](Images\example_info.jpg)

Information windows simply confirm a choice made by the user. They are non-critical.

### Warning Windows

![](Images\example_warning.jpg)

A warning window highlights a potential problem in the dataset selected by the user. This problem may be critical or non-critical and it is up to the user to decide whether to proceed.

### Error Windows

![](Images\example_error.jpg)

An error window indicates that an incorrect entry has been made into an input field, that an invalid selection has been made or that a dataset has a critical problem. This is a critical problem and needs to be addressed before proceeding with the wizard. In some cases, for example if the dataset has a critical problem, the user may need to exit the wizard, address the problem and then start afresh.

How does PyLUR work?
--------------------

PyLUR is written in Python. It consists of two script tools, BuildLUR and ApplyLUR, which are stored in the PyLUR toolbox in the PyLUR project. The diagram below provides an overview of the architecture and process flow associated with each tool.

![](Images\architecture.png)

Data Preparation
================

It is essential to prepare the data carefully prior to using PyLUR. PyLUR will carry out some very basic checks of the data, i.e. it will check that features are located within the study area and if necessary display a warning message. **PyLUR will not clean or prepare the data for use in the BuildLUR wizard.** Users should carefully check all feature classes and raster files that they intend to use. In particular, feature classes should be checked for spatial duplicates (e.g. using the Find Identical and Delete Identical tools) and invalid geometries (e.g. using the Check Geometry and Repair Geometry tools).

To be used by the BuildLUR tool all feature classes and raster files must be stored in **the same File Geodatabase**.

The following tabs show further information for different input datasets.

Study Area
----------

The file geodatabase must contain a **polygon feature class** that represents the boundaries of the study area.

This feature class **must contain**:

-   exactly one feature, which as a minimum encompasses all of the monitoring sites.

Typically, a feature class of administrative boundaries is used to define the study area. For example, the red polygon below shows the boundary of the Greater Manchester administrative area. If no such feature class is available, it can be created, either manually or by using the Minimum Bounding Geometry Tool.

![](Images\GM_area.jpg)

Dependent Variable
------------------

The file geodatabase must contain a **point feature class** of the monitoring sites, which will be used as the dependent variable when building the LUR model. Each row in this feature class must be a unique location, i.e. there must be no spatial duplicates.

The point feature class **must contain**:

-   a text field with a unique identifier for each monitoring site.

-   one or more numeric fields with monitored values (e.g. pollutant concentrations, temperatures, bacterial counts).

The table below shows an example of an attribute table of a monitoring sites feature class. The feature class may contain other fields. These will be ignored during the analysis, but they may slow down the performance of the PyLUR tools.

![](Images\Example_DepVar.jpg)

Predictor Variables
-------------------

Predictor variables can be derived from both vector data and raster data. Multiple predictor variables can be derived from a single vector dataset, depending on additional criteria such as the number of buffers, attribute categories and aggregation methods. In contrast, only a single predictor can be derived from a raster dataset. To build a LUR model, typically hundreds of potential predictor variables are extracted and then assessed in the statistical analysis. Technically, the BuildLUR tool can be run with only one predictor, but the resulting model will be very limited.

### Vector maps

From vector data predictor variables can be extracted based on circular buffers around the monitoring sites or based on the distance to the nearest feature. Each of these methods can be applied to polygon, line or point vector data.

#### Buffer based Predictors

PyLUR will draw one or more circular buffers around each monitoring site (the radius of the buffer is determined by the user). It will then use the Intersect tool to extract features and their associated attributes from a polygon, line or point feature class selected by the user. Geometric attributes are automatically recalculated.

This feature class **must contain**:

-   a text field which identifies the category that each feature belongs to. For example, a polygon feature class of land use would contain a text field that identifies which land use category (e.g. residential, commercial, industrial) each polygon feature belongs to. A road feature class would contain a text field that identifies the road type (e.g. motorway, primary, secondary) of each line feature. A tree feature class might contain a text field that shows the species of each point feature. The text of the category field will be used as part of the variable naming schema, for details of the name schema see Step 3 - Predictors. Any whitespace or underscores in the text of the category field will be removed.

![](Images\Example_Buffer1.png)

If the features of the feature class cannot be categorised, then a text field should be used in which all features have the same value. For example, a polygon feature class of population density would not need a category; therefore a "dummy" text field should be added with identical values. In a line feature class of roads it may also be useful to analyse all roads as well as roads by category, therefore to this feature class an additional text field could be added in which all fields are set to "all". The tables below show some examples of "dummy" category fields.

![](Images\Example_Buffer2.png)

The feature class **may contain**:

-   one or more numeric fields showing attribute values for each feature. If the chosen aggregation method is total area, total length or point count, a numeric field is not required. However, if the chosen aggregation method is area weighted value, area\*value, length weighted value, length\*value, sum of values, mean of values or median of values, then the feature class must contain at least one numeric field (see *Build LUR Step 3 - Predictors* for further information on aggregation methods). For example, a line feature class of roads may contain one or more fields showing traffic counts for each feature (line segment or row in the attribute table). A point feature class of chimney stacks may contain a field showing emission rates for each feature. The attribute tables below show some examples of value fields.

![](Images\Example_Buffer3.png)

#### Distance based Predictors

PyLUR will identify the nearest polygon, line or point feature to each monitoring site point location from a feature class selected by the user The nearest feature is based on the Euclidean (straight line) distance and is expressed in the map units defined by the coordinate system specified the BuildLUR tool. Depending on the chosen method it will calculate the distance to the nearest feature, provide the value of an attribute of the nearest feature (e.g. traffic flow) or calculate a combination of these two.

The feature class **may contain**:

-   one or more numeric fields showing attribute values for each feature. If the chosen method is distance, inverse distance or inverse distance squared, then a numeric field is not required. However, if the chosen method is value, value\*distance, value\*inverse distance or value\*inverse distance squared, then the feature class must contain at least one numeric field. For example, a line feature class of roads may contain one or more fields showing traffic counts for each feature (line segment or row in attribute table). A point feature class of chimney stacks may contain a field showing emission rates for each feature. The attribute tables below show some examples of value fields.

![](Images\Example_Distance1.png)

### Raster maps

From raster data only the value of the raster cell that is spatially coincident with the monitoring site point can be extracted. Since standard raster grids can only hold one value per cell, no table schema is required.

Build LUR
=========

To create a new LUR model double-click the BuildLUR script in the PyLUR toolbox. The BuildLUR tool will appear in the Geoprocessing pane. Click the Run button in the bottom right corner to run the tool.

![](Images\build_tool.jpg)

This will open the BuildLUR wizard. The wizard will guide you through the process of creating a LUR model by using the following steps:

Step 1 - Settings
-----------------

This step is required to specify some general settings to build a LUR model.

<h2 style="font-size:125%;font-weight:normal;">
Enter WKID number
</h2>
<p>
The user must specify a <strong>projected</strong> coordinate system for the data. The wizard will automatically create a feature dataset called <em>LURdata</em> inside the <em>\[Project name\]\_\[Date\_Time\].gdb</em> file geodatabase. The specified coordinate system will be used as the spatial reference for the <em>LURdata</em> feature datatset. Feature classes selected during step 2 (Outcomes) and step 3 (Predictors) of the wizard will be imported into the <em>LURdata</em> feature dataset prior to analysis. This ensures that all feature classes used in the analysis have the same spatial reference. Raster files will be projected into the specified coordinate system prior to analysis, due to the fact that they cannot be imported into a feature dataset.
</p>
<p>
ESRI uses the Well-Known ID (WKID) to define the spatial reference. Use <a href="https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/map/projections/pdf/projected_coordinate_systems.pdf">this link</a> to find the WKID of the projected coordinate system of your choice. For example the British National Grid is WKID:27700.
</p>
<p>
Click the <span style="border:1px; border-style:solid; border-color:#040404; background-color:#C4C4C4; padding:0px 2px">OK</span> button. If a valid WKID has been entered, the name of the selected coordinate system will be shown. Click the <span style="border:1px; border-style:solid; border-color:#040404; background-color:#C4C4C4; padding:0px 2px">OK</span> button and a green tick mark will appear.
</p>
<p style="border:2px; border-style:solid; border-color:#FF0000;background-color:#ffcccc; padding:5px">
The unit of the coordinate system will determine the unit of the buffer distances. For example, if the coordinate system is defined in metres, then the buffer distances need to be specified in metres. If the coordinate system is defined in feet, then the buffer distances need to be specified in feet.

</body>
</html>
<!--/html_preserve-->
Step 3 - Predictors
-------------------

In this step the predictor or independent variables of the regression analysis are specified.

Predictor variables can be derived from vector data and from raster data. From vector data predictor variables can be extracted based on circular buffers around the monitoring site point locations or based on the distance to the nearest feature. Since vector data can be polygons, lines or points, this results in six possible types of predictor variables. From raster data only the value of the raster cell that is spatially coincident with the monitoring site point can be extracted, adding one more possible type of predictor. Therefore, in total seven types of predictor variables can be extracted and entered into the statistical analysis. Each type of variable can produce multiple predictors, depending on additional settings such as the number of buffer distances, the number of categories within a feature class, or the aggregation/extraction method specified.

![](Images\Predictors.jpg)

### Buffer based Predictors

#### Polygon Area or Value within Buffer

For this type of variable a polygon feature class should be used, which has a spatial extent that is larger than: the study area + the largest buffer distance. The polygon feature class should not contain duplicates or invalid geometries (if uncertain about invalid geometries, run the Repair Geometries tool prior to running the wizard). The polygon feature class must contain a text field, which identifies a category for each polygon. If the feature class contains only one category, a dummy text field should be created with all rows set to the same value.

**Polygon Area within Buffer**

<img src="Images\PolyInBuffer_MultCategories.jpg" width="500px" height="500px" />

This example diagram is based on a polygon feature class with four categories (A,B,C,D). For a given buffer distance the wizard will calculate the total area (in the squared map unit of the projected coordinate system) of each category within the buffer, e.g.

-   Total area of category A = Area of A<sub>1</sub> + Area of A<sub>2</sub> + Area A<sub>3</sub>
-   Total area of category B = Area of B<sub>1</sub> + Area of B<sub>2</sub> + Area B<sub>3</sub>
-   Total area of category C = Area of C<sub>1</sub> + Area of C<sub>2</sub> + Area C<sub>3</sub>
-   Total area of category D = Area of D<sub>1</sub> + Area of D<sub>2</sub> + Area D<sub>3</sub> + Area D<sub>4</sub>

A real life example of this variable type would be a polygon feature class of land use. Each category would contain a different type of land use, for example residential, industrial, natural etc. Total land areas of each land use category within the circular buffer would be produced, e.g. in m<sup>2</sup> for the British National Grid.

**Polygon Value within Buffer**

<img src="Images\PolyInBuffer_MultCatValue.jpg" width="500px" height="500px" />

This example diagram is based on a polygon feature class with four categories (A,B,C,D) and each polygon has a numeric value attribute ("Value"). For a given buffer distance the wizard will calculate the total area weighted value for each category within the buffer, e.g.

-   Total area weighted value of category A = ((Area of A<sub>1</sub> inside buffer ÷ Total Area of A<sub>1</sub>) × Value of A<sub>1</sub>) + ((Area of A<sub>2</sub> inside buffer ÷ Total Area of A<sub>2</sub>) × Value of A<sub>2</sub>)
-   Total area weighted value of category B = ((Area of B<sub>1</sub> inside buffer ÷ Total Area of B<sub>1</sub>) × Value of B<sub>1</sub>) + ((Area of B<sub>2</sub> inside buffer ÷ Total Area of B<sub>2</sub>) × Value of B<sub>2</sub>)
-   Total area weighted value of category C = ((Area of C<sub>1</sub> inside buffer ÷ Total Area of C<sub>1</sub>) × Value of C<sub>1</sub>) + ((Area of C<sub>2</sub> inside buffer ÷ Total Area of C<sub>2</sub>) × Value of C<sub>2</sub>)
-   Total area weighted value of category D = ((Area of D<sub>1</sub> inside buffer ÷ Total Area of D<sub>1</sub>) × Value of D<sub>1</sub>) + ((Area of D<sub>2</sub> inside buffer ÷ Total Area of D<sub>2</sub>) × Value of D<sub>2</sub>)

A real life example of this variable type would be a polygon feature class of population density.

Alternatively, the wizard can calculate the total sum of the product of the polygon area and the polygon value, e.g.

-   Total sum of product of area and value of category A = (Area of A<sub>1</sub> inside buffer × Value of A<sub>1</sub>) + (Area of A<sub>2</sub> inside buffer × Value of A<sub>2</sub>)
-   Total sum of product of area and value of category B = (Area of B<sub>1</sub> inside buffer × Value of B<sub>1</sub>) + (Area of B<sub>2</sub> inside buffer × Value of B<sub>2</sub>)
-   Total sum of product of area and value of category C = (Area of C<sub>1</sub> inside buffer × Value of C<sub>1</sub>) + (Area of C<sub>2</sub> inside buffer × Value of C<sub>2</sub>)
-   Total sum of product of area and value of category D = (Area of D<sub>1</sub> inside buffer × Value of D<sub>1</sub>) + (Area of D<sub>2</sub> inside buffer × Value of D<sub>2</sub>)

A real life example of this variable type would be a polygon feature class of area emission sources such as fugitive emissions from land use categories based on different estimated car parking densities. Another example is anthropogenic heat emissions from different residential land uses depending on housing characteristics and estimated energy use.

Define Direction of Effect

<p>
For each row in this box select whether the predictor variable is expected to have a positive or a negative direction of effect. The user has to make an <em>a priori</em> assumption for each predictor variable: a positive direction of effect is a predictor variable that will increase the value of the dependent variable, i.e. it is considered to be a source of the dependent variable and the beta coefficient is expected to be positive. A negative direction of effect is a predictor variable that will decrease the value of the dependent variable, i.e. it is considered to be a sink of the dependent variable and the beta coefficient is expected to be negative. These specifications will be used as model selection criteria in the statistical analysis; therefore, the user must consider carefully whether each predictor variable has a positive or a negative direction of effect. <strong>Incorrect specifications will lead to incorrect LUR models!</strong>

#### Line Length or Value within Buffer

For this type of variable a line feature class should be used, which has a spatial extent that is larger than: the study area + the largest buffer distance. The line feature class should not contain duplicates.The line feature class must contain a text field, which identifies a category for each line. If the feature class contains only one category, a dummy text field should be created with all rows set to the same value.

**Line Length within Buffer**

<img src="Images\LineInBuffer_MultCat.jpg" width="500px" height="500px" />

This example diagram is based on a line feature class with two categories (A,B). For a given buffer distance the wizard will calculate the total length (in the map unit of the projected coordinate system) of each category within the buffer, e.g.

-   Total length of category A = Length of A<sub>1</sub> + Length of A<sub>2</sub>
-   Total length of category B = Length of B<sub>1</sub> + Length of B<sub>2</sub> + Length B<sub>3</sub> + Length B<sub>4</sub> + Length B<sub>5</sub> + Length B<sub>6</sub>

A real life example of this variable type would be a line feature class of roads. Each category would contain a different type of road, for example motorway, local street etc. Total line lengths of each land use category within the circular buffer would be produced, e.g. in m for the British National Grid.

**Line Value within Buffer**

<img src="Images\LineInBuffer_MultValue.jpg" width="500px" height="500px" />

This example diagram is based on a line feature class with two categories (A,B) and each line has a numeric value. For a given buffer distance the wizard will calculate the total length weighted value for each category within the buffer, e.g.

-   Total length weighted value of category A = ((Length of A<sub>1</sub> inside buffer ÷ Total Length of A<sub>1</sub>) × Value of A<sub>1</sub>) + ((Length of A<sub>2</sub> inside buffer ÷ Total Length of A<sub>2</sub>) × Value of A<sub>2</sub>)
-   Total length weighted value of category B = ((Length of B<sub>1</sub> inside buffer ÷ Total Length of B<sub>1</sub>) × Value of B<sub>1</sub>) + ((Length of B<sub>2</sub> inside buffer ÷ Total Length of B<sub>2</sub>) × Value of B<sub>2</sub>) + ((Length of B<sub>3</sub> inside buffer ÷ Total Length of B<sub>3</sub>) × Value of B<sub>3</sub>) + ((Length of B<sub>4</sub> inside buffer ÷ Total Length of B<sub>4</sub>) × Value of B<sub>4</sub>) + ((Length of B<sub>5</sub> inside buffer ÷ Total Length of B<sub>5</sub>) × Value of B<sub>5</sub>) + ((Length of B<sub>6</sub> inside buffer ÷ Total Length of B<sub>6</sub>) × Value of B<sub>6</sub>)

A real life example of this variable type would be a line feature class of traffic counts.

Alternatively, the wizard can calculate the total sum of the product of the line length and the line value, e.g.

-   Total sum of product of length and value of category A = (Length of A<sub>1</sub> inside buffer × Value of A<sub>1</sub>) + (Length of A<sub>2</sub> inside buffer × Value of A<sub>2</sub>)
-   Total sum of product of length and value of category B = (Length of B<sub>1</sub> inside buffer × Value of B<sub>1</sub>) + (Length of B<sub>2</sub> inside buffer × Value of B<sub>2</sub>) + (Length of B<sub>3</sub> inside buffer × Value of B<sub>3</sub>) + (Length of B<sub>4</sub> inside buffer × Value of B<sub>4</sub>) + (Length of B<sub>5</sub> inside buffer × Value of B<sub>5</sub>) + (Length of B<sub>6</sub> inside buffer × Value of B<sub>6</sub>) +

A real life example of this variable type would be a line feature class of proxy emissions loadings represented by average vehicle-kilometres per day.

For each row in this box select whether the predictor variable is expected to have a positive or a negative direction of effect. The user has to make an <em>a priori</em> assumption for each predictor variable: a positive direction of effect is a predictor variable that will increase the value of the dependent variable, i.e. it is considered to be a source of the dependent variable and the beta coefficient is expected to be positive. A negative direction of effect is a predictor variable that will decrease the value of the dependent variable, i.e. it is considered to be a sink of the dependent variable and the beta coefficient is expected to be negative. These specifications will be used as model selection criteria in the statistical analysis; therefore, the user must consider carefully whether each predictor variable has a positive or a negative direction of effect. <strong>Incorrect specifications will lead to incorrect LUR models!</strong>

#### Point Count or Value within Buffer

For this type of variable a point feature class should be used, which has a spatial extent that is larger than: the study area + the largest buffer distance. The point feature class should not contain duplicates. The point feature class must contain a text field, which identifies a category for each point. If the feature class contains only one category, a dummy text field should be created with all rows set to the same value.

**Point Count within Buffer**

<img src="Images\PointInBuffer_MultCat.jpg" width="500px" height="500px" />

This example diagram is based on a point feature class with three categories (A,B,C). For a given buffer distance the wizard will count the number of points belonging to each category within the buffer, e.g.

-   Total count of category A = {A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>}
-   Total count of category B = {B<sub>1</sub> }
-   Total count of category C = {C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>}

A real life example of this variable type would be a point feature class of trees. Each category would contain a different tree species, for example *Quercus robur, Fagus sylvatica, Cornus sanguinea* etc.The count would therefore be the number of individuals of each species within the buffer. Another example would be the count of particular stacks (chimneys) used as a proxy of emission rates.

**Point Value within Buffer**

<img src="Images\PointInBuffer_MultValue.jpg" width="500px" height="500px" />

This example diagram is based on a point feature class with three categories (A,B,C) and each point has a numeric value. For a given buffer distance the wizard will calculate the sum of values for each category within the buffer, e.g.

-   Sum of values of category A = Value of A<sub>1</sub> + Value of A<sub>2</sub>
-   Sum of values of category B = Value of B<sub>1</sub>
-   Sum of values of category C = Value of C<sub>1</sub> + Value of C<sub>2</sub>

A real life example of this variable type would be a point feature class of chimney stacks with different emission rates (e.g. grammes of NOx per hour).

Alternatively, the wizard can calculate the mean or median of the values, e.g.

-   Mean of values of category A = (Value of A<sub>1</sub> + Value of A<sub>2</sub>) ÷ Number of points within buffer belonging to category A
-   Mean of values of category B = Value of B<sub>1</sub> ÷ Number of points within buffer belonging to category B
-   Mean of values of category C = (Value of C<sub>1</sub> + Value of C) ÷ Number of points within buffer belonging to category C<sub>2</sub>

A real life example of this variable type would be tree height.

### Distance based Predictors

#### Distance to and/or Value of nearest Polygon

For this type of variable a polygon feature class should be used, which ideally has a spatial extent that is larger than the study area. The polygon feature class must not contain spatial duplicates or invalid geometries (if uncertain about invalid geometries, run the Repair Geometries tool prior to running the wizard).

![](Images\PolygonDistance.jpg)

This example diagram shows a feature class of non-contiguous polygons with different values for each feature. For each each point feature representing a monitoring site the wizard will identify the nearest polygon and calculate one or more of the following options:

-   Distance = The distance to the nearest polygon edge (in the map unit of the projected coordinate system)
-   Inverse distance = 1 ÷ distance to the nearest polygon edge
-   Inverse distance squared = 1 ÷ (distance to the nearest polygon edge)<sup>2</sup>
-   Value = The value of the nearest polygon
-   Value \* Distance = The value of the nearest polygon × the distance to the nearest polygon edge
-   Value \* Inverse distance = The value of the nearest polygon × (1 ÷ distance to the nearest polygon edge)
-   Value \* Inverse distance squared = The value of the nearest polygon × (1 ÷ (distance to the nearest polygon edge)<sup>2</sup>)

A real life example of this variable type would be proximity to water bodies with the potential to reduce air temperatures monitored at weather stations or the impact of fugitive emission sources from industrial sites on air quality. Inverse squared distance values are useful to represent the importance of distance, i.e. to give greater importance to nearby polygon features compared with those further away. A Value attribute field might be useful if the size of the feature is important, e.g. livestock densities on agricultural land parcels in the case of ambient ammonia concentrations.

<style>
div.red {border:2px; border-style:solid; border-color:#FF0000; background-color:#ffcccc; padding:5px;}
</style>
If the monitoring site is located on top of a polygon (i.e. the distance is zero) the Inverse distance, Inverse distance squared, Value \* Inverse Distance, and Value \* Inverse distance squared options will produce a division by zero error and the result for the feature will be set to **missing**. The Distance and Value \* Distance options will produce a result of **zero**. Therefore, the user should carefully inspect the data prior to using these options.

These specifications will be used as model selection criteria in the statistical analysis; therefore, the user must consider carefully whether each predictor variable has a positive or a negative direction of effect. <strong>Incorrect specifications will lead to incorrect LUR models!</strong>
<p>
For example, the distance to a polygon that will increase the dependent variable (i.e. a source polygon) is assumed to have a negative direction of effect (i.e. it is expected to have a negative coefficient), because as distance increases the value of the predictor variable increases, while the actual effect of the polygon decreases. Conversely, the inverse distance and inverse distance squared to a polygon that will increase the dependent variable is assumed to have a positive direction of effect, because as distance increases the calculated value (i.e. 1/distance) of the predictor variable becomes smaller, as does the effect of the polygon.

#### Distance to and/or Value of nearest Line

For this type of variable a line feature class should be used, which ideally has a spatial extent that is larger than the study area. The line feature class must not contain spatial duplicates.

![](Images\LineDistance.jpg)

This example diagram shows a line feature class with different values for each feature. For each point feature representing a monitoring site loaction the wizard will identify the nearest line and calculate one or more of the following options:

-   Distance = The distance to the nearest line (in the map unit of the projected coordinate system)
-   Inverse distance = 1 ÷ distance to the nearest line
-   Inverse distance squared = 1 ÷ (distance to the nearest line)<sup>2</sup> - Value = The value of the nearest line
-   Value \* Distance = The value of the nearest line × the distance to the nearest line
-   Value \* Inverse distance = The value of the nearest line × (1 ÷ distance to the nearest line)
-   Value \* Inverse distance squared = The value of the nearest line × (1 ÷ (distance to the nearest line)<sup>2</sup>)

A real life example of this variable type would be proximity to the nearest road feature to represent the potential for higher ambient air pollutant concentrations due to vehicular emissions or proximity to the nearest river to represent the potential for lower air temperatures at nearby weather stations. Inverse squared distance values are useful to represent the importance of distance, i.e. to give greater importance to nearby line features compared with those further away. A Value attribute field might be useful if the size of the feature is important, e.g. roads with an attribute representing traffic volume.

If the monitoring site is located on top of a line (i.e. the distance is zero) the Inverse distance, Inverse distance squared, Value \* Inverse Distance, and Value \* Inverse distance squared options will produce a division by zero error and the result for the feature will be set to **missing**. The Distance and Value \* Distance options will produce a result of **zero**. Therefore, the user should carefully inspect the data prior to using these options.

#### Distance to and/or Value of nearest Point

For this type of variable a point feature class should be used, which ideally has a spatial extent that is larger than the study area. The point feature class must not contain spatial duplicates.

![](Images\PointDistance.jpg)

This example diagram shows a point feature class with different values for each feature. For each monitoring site the wizard will identify the nearest point and calculate one or more of the following options:

-   Distance = The distance to the nearest point (in the map unit of the projected coordinate system)
-   Inverse distance = 1 ÷ distance to the nearest point
-   Inverse distance squared = 1 ÷ (distance to the nearest point)<sup>2</sup> - Value = The value of the nearest point
-   Value \* Distance = The value of the nearest point × the distance to the nearest point
-   Value \* Inverse distance = The value of the nearest point × (1 ÷ distance to the nearest point)
-   Value \* Inverse distance squared = The value of the nearest point × (1 ÷ (distance to the nearest point)<sup>2</sup>)

A real life example of this variable type would be proximity to the nearest point feature representing a chimney stack. In this case closer distances are more likely to result in higher pollutant concentrations. Inverse squared distance values are useful to represent the importance of distance, i.e. to give greater importance to nearby point features compared with those further away. A Value attribute field might be useful if the size of the feature is important, e.g. the emission rate from the chimney stack.

If the monitoring site is located on top of a point (i.e. the distance is zero) the Inverse distance, Inverse distance squared, Value \* Inverse Distance, and Value \* Inverse distance squared options will produce a division by zero error and the result for the feature will be set to **missing**. The Distance and Value \* Distance options will produce a result of **zero**. Therefore, the user should carefully inspect the data prior to using these options.

### Raster based Predictors

#### Value of Raster cell

For this type of variable a raster grid file should be used, which ideally has a spatial extent that is larger than the study area. The wizard will extract the value of the raster cell that is spatially coincident with the point location representing the monitoring site (dependent variable).

An example of the use of this predictor variable type is elevation. Elevation is commonly sourced from a Digital Elevation Model stored as a raster grid.

Select whether the predictor variable is expected to have a positive or a negative direction of effect. The user has to make an <em>a priori</em> assumption for each predictor variable: a positive direction of effect is a predictor variable that will increase the value of the dependent variable, i.e. it is considered to be a source of the dependent variable and the beta coefficient is expected to be positive. A negative direction of effect is a predictor variable that will decrease the value of the dependent variable, i.e. it is considered to be a sink of the dependent variable and the beta coefficient is expected to be negative. These specifications will be used as model selection criteria in the statistical analysis; therefore, the user must consider carefully whether each predictor variable has a positive or a negative direction of effect. <strong>Incorrect specifications will lead to incorrect LUR models!</strong>

Troubleshooting
===============

Known issues
------------

1.  After closing the PyLUR project and exiting ArcGIS Pro you may see a warning message similar to this one:

<img src="Images\ShutdownWarning.png" style="border:1px; border-style:solid; border-color:#8c8c8c;" />

This is a warning only, it is not a critical error. This is a known issue and it has been reported to ESRI as a potential bug.

1.  Running the PyLUR tools repeatedly may cause ArcGIS Pro to crash. This may be related to the warning shown in issue 1. It is recommended to restart ArcGIS Pro between separate runs of the PyLUR tools.

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

-   ***In my data each land use type is stored in an individual feature class. How can I use these data?***

Add a text field to each feature class. In each feature class set all rows of this new text field to the same value. For example, you could set all rows to show the name of the type of land use that is stored in this feature class.

-   ***I cannot read the full name of an option in a dropdown menu, because the name is very long***

Enlarge the window by dragging its right side or click the maximise button in the title bar.

-   ***I cannot see the Finish button on the Model page***

Enlarge the window by clicking the maximise button in the title bar.

-   ***Some of my receptor points were not modelled by the ApplyLUR tool***

Please inspect your receptor points carefully on a map and look at the predictor variables in your LUR models. If the LUR models contain predictors that are derived from the Inverse distance, Inverse distance squared, Value \* Inverse Distance, or Value \* Inverse distance squared to the nearest feature method, then any receptor points spatially coincident with the nearest feature will be dropped to prevent a division by zero error.

Tutorial
========

This section provides a guided tutorial for building and applying a LUR model using the PyLUR wizard. In this tutorial you will build and apply a predictive air pollution model for the Greater Manchester area using openly accessible datasets on monitored Nitrogen Dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) concentrations, land use categories, road networks, and emission sources.

Before you start
----------------

1.  Ensure that you have cloned or downloaded the PyLUR repository from GitHub, including the ExampleData folder.
2.  Follow the instructions in the [Installation](#installation) section to ensure that the additional Python packages required by PyLUR have been installed.
3.  Create a directory where you would like to store outputs from the model, for example C:\\Work\\PyLUROutput. Please ensure that you have write access to this directory and that there are no spaces in the file path.

Starting the PyLUR wizard
-------------------------

1.  Start ArcGIS Pro and open the PyLUR project. The PyLUR.aprx project file can be found in the PyLUR folder in the PyLUR repository.
2.  In the Catalog window right-click Folders and click Add Folder Connection. Create a connection to the ExampleData.gdb file geodatabase, which is stored in the ExampleData folder in the PyLUR repository.
3.  Double-click toolboxes, double-click PyLUR.tbx, then double-click the BuildLUR script. In the Geoprocessing window on the right click Run. This will open the Build LUR wizard.

Settings
--------

On this page you will specify the general settings required by PyLUR wizard.

1.  **Set Project Name**
    -   Next to Project Name type a suitable name for your LUR model (e.g. MyFirstLUR) and click Enter.
2.  **Set Directories**
    -   Click the Browse button next to Input File Geodatabase and navigate to ExampleData.gdb.
    -   Click the Browse button next to Output Folder and navigate to the directory where you would like to store outputs from the model.
3.  **Set Coordinate System**
    -   You must specify a projected coordinate system for the data. The help menu provides a link to the well-known ID (WKID) numbers for the coordinate systems provided in ArcGIS Pro. In this tutorial you will use the British National Grid projected coordinate system. Its WKID is 27700.
4.  **Set Study Area**
    -   From the dropdown menu select GMArea.

The completed Settings page should look like this:

<img src="Images\Example_P1.png" style="border:1px; border-style:solid; border-color:#8c8c8c;" />

Click Next &gt; to continue.

Outcomes
--------

On this page you will specify the data that will be used as the outcome that the LUR model needs to predict. In this tutorial the outcome is annual average Nitrogen Dioxide concentrations measured by diffusion tubes in the Greater Manchester area.

1.  **Set Dependent Variable**
    -   From the dropdown menu next to Monitoring Sites select GMDiffusionTubes.
    -   From the dropdown menu next to Select Site ID select SiteID.
    -   In the box next to Dependent Variables tick NO2, then click Select. In the box below Outcomes Added depNO2 should appear.

The completed Outcomes page should look like this:

<img src="Images\Example_P2.png" style="border:1px; border-style:solid; border-color:#8c8c8c;" />

Click Next &gt; to continue.

Predictors
----------

On the next pages you will specify potential predictors for the LUR model. Potential predictor variables fall into seven types and further information on these types is provided in the help menu. You can add as many or as few predictors as you wish. You can see in the box below Predictors Added that the coordinates of each monitoring site have been automatically added as potential predictor variables.

Click the Add button next to A. Polygon Area or Value within Buffer.

### Polygon Area or Value within Buffer

Through this page you will create potential predictor variables that are based on drawing circular buffers around each monitoring site and extracting the area or attribute value from a polygon feature class that intersects these buffers. For the purpose of this tutorial you will create predictors that show the area of different land use categories within each buffer.

1.  **Set Variable Name**
    -   In the box next to Variable Name type a name for the variable to be created, e.g. landuseArea, then click Enter.
2.  **Set Buffer Sizes**
    -   In the box next to Buffer Distance type in 100 (this will create a buffer with a radius of 100m), then click Add. The buffer distance that you have added will appear in the box below.
    -   Repeat this step to add buffer distances of 300, 500, 1000, and 5000. If you make a mistake, select the incorrect buffer distance and click remove.
    -   Once all buffer distances have been entered click Done.
3.  **Set Input Data**
    -   From the dropdown menu next to Polygon Feature Class select CorineLanduse.
    -   From the dropdown menu next to Category Field select LanduseCat.
    -   Under Aggregation Method select Total area.
4.  **Set Direction of Effect**
    -   The box next to Define Direction of Effect is automatically populated with the names of the predictor variables that will be created. In this case the variable name includes the name that was entered at the top of the page (landuseArea), the names of the land use categories (HDres,Industry,LDres,Natural,UrbGreen,Port), the buffer distances (100,300,500,1000,5000), and the aggregation method (sum indicates that the total area within the buffer will be used). For each predictor variable you must now select whether the *a priori* assumed direction of effect of the predictor is positive or negative. This is a critical step, for further information on this click the help button. In an air pollution study it is usually assumed that urban and industrial land uses increase pollution levels, i.e. their direction of effect will be positive, while natural land uses decrease pollution levels, i.e. their direction of effect will be negative. Scroll through the list of predictor variables and set all HDres, Industry, LDres, and Port variables to Positive. Set all Natural and UrbGreen variables to Negative, then click done.

The completed page should look like this:

<img src="Images\Example_P3A.png" style="border:1px; border-style:solid; border-color:#8c8c8c;" />

Click Next &gt; to continue. The Predictors page will open again (this may take a while). You can see that in the box below Predictors Added the new predictors have been added together with their assumed direction of effect.

You will now create predictors that show oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emitted from the area within buffers surrounding the monitoring sites. Data on NOx emission rates comes in different formats and for this predictor variable you will use emission rates aggregated at an area level (in this case regular square polygons). Since the buffers do not match the emission polygons exactly, the emission rate values need to be area weighted.

Click the Add button next to A. Polygon Area or Value within Buffer.

1.  **Set Variable Name**
    -   In the box next to Variable Name type a name for the variable to be created, e.g. EmissionAreaWt, then click Enter.
2.  **Set Buffer Sizes**
    -   For the buffer distances enter 100, 300, 500, 1000, and 5000.
3.  **Set Input Data**
    -   From the dropdown menu next to Polygon Feature Class select TotalNoxEmissionAsNO2\_Tiles.
    -   From the dropdown menu next to Category Field select DummyCat. Since categories are not relevant for this dataset a dummy variable has been added, which assigns all polygons to the same category.
    -   Under Aggregation Method select Area weighted value.
    -   From the dropdown menu next to Value Field select NOxEmission.
4.  **Set Direction of Effect**
    -   The box next to Define Direction of Effect shows the names of the predictor variables that will be created. For these variables the name includes the name that was entered at the top of the page (EmissionAreaWt), the name in the dummy category (All), the buffer distances (100,300,500,1000,5000), and the aggregation method (wtv indicates that an area weighted value will be used). This type of predictor variable represents emission rates of pollution, therefore its direction of effect is obviously assumed to be positive. Scroll through the list of predictor variables and set all variables to Positive, then click done.

The completed page should look like this:

<img src="Images\Example_P3A_2.png" style="border:1px; border-style:solid; border-color:#8c8c8c;" />

Click Next &gt; to continue. You may see a Warning box. Click OK and the warning will disappear and the Predictors page will open (this may take a while).

Click the Add button next to B. Line Length or Value within Buffer.

### Line Length or Value within Buffer

Through this page you will create potential predictor variables that are based on drawing circular buffers around each monitoring site and extracting the length or attribute value from a line feature class that intersects these buffers. For this tutorial you will create predictors that show the lengths of major and minor roads within each buffer.

1.  **Set Variable Name**
    -   In the box next to Variable Name type a name for the variable to be created, e.g. rdLength, then click Enter.
2.  **Set Buffer Sizes**
    -   For the buffer distances enter 25, 50, 100, 300, 500, and 1000.
3.  **Set Input Data**
    -   From the dropdown menu next to Line Feature Class select OSM\_AllRoads.
    -   From the dropdown menu next to Category Field select RoadCat.
    -   Under Aggregation Method select Total length.
4.  **Set Direction of Effect**
    -   Traffic is a major source of air pollution in urban areas. Therefore, it is expected that a higher road density will increase pollution levels. Scroll through the list of predictor variables and set all variables to Positive, then click Done

The completed page should look like this:

<img src="Images\Example_P3B.png" style="border:1px; border-style:solid; border-color:#8c8c8c;" />

Click Next &gt; to continue. The Predictors page will open again (this may take a while).

Click the Add button next to C. Point Count or Value within Buffer.

### Point Count or Value within Buffer

Through this page you will create potential predictor variables that are based on drawing circular buffers around each monitoring site and extracting the number of points or a statistic of their attribute values from a point feature class that intersects these buffers. In this case you will create predictors that show the sum of NOx emissions from point sources within each buffer by industry sector.

1.  **Set Variable Name**
    -   In the box next to Variable Name type a name for the variable to be created, e.g. EmissionPoint, then click Enter.
2.  **Set Buffer Sizes**
    -   For the buffer distances enter 100, 300, 500, 1000, and 5000.
3.  **Set Input Data**
    -   From the dropdown menu next to Point Feature Class select NOxEmissionPointSources.
    -   From the dropdown menu next to Category Field select SectorCat.
    -   Under Aggregation Method select Sum of values.
    -   From the dropdown menu next to Value Field select Emission.
4.  **Set Direction of Effect**
    -   Since emission sources will increase pollution levels, the direction of effect of all variables should be set to Positive. Click Done.

The completed page should look like this:

<img src="Images\Example_P3C.png" style="border:1px; border-style:solid; border-color:#8c8c8c;" />

Click Next &gt; to continue. The Predictors page will open again (this may take a while).

Click the Add button next to D. Distance to and/or Value of nearest Polygon.

### Distance to and/or value of nearest Polygon

Through this page you will create potential predictor variables that show the distance from each monitoring site to the nearest polygon, or the value of the nearest polygon or a combination of the distance and the value. As shown above NOx emission sources can be processed in different formats: as point sources or aggregated to an area level (as square polygons). For the purpose of this tutorial you will extract an area level emission rate for each monitoring site, which will be the emission rate of the polygon that the monitoring site is located on.

1.  **Set Variable Name**
    -   In the box next to Variable Name type a name for the variable to be created, e.g. EmissionAreaVal, then click Enter.
2.  **Set Method**
    -   In the box next to Data to be extracted tick Value, then click Select.
3.  **Set Input Data**
    -   From the dropdown menu next to Polygon Feature Class select TotalNoxEmissionAsNO2\_Tiles.
    -   In the box next to Value Field(s) tick NOxEmission, then click Select.
4.  **Set Direction of Effect**
    -   Again, as NOx emissions increase, air pollution levels will increase; therefore, the direction of effect should be set to Positive. Click Done.

The completed page should look like this:

<img src="Images\Example_P3D.png" style="border:1px; border-style:solid; border-color:#8c8c8c;" />

Click Next &gt; to continue. The Predictors page will open again.

Click the Add button next to E. Distance to and/or Value of nearest Line.

### Distance to and/or value of nearest Line

Through this page you will create potential predictor variables that show the distance from each monitoring site to the nearest line, or the value of the nearest line or a combination of the distance and the value. For this tutorial you will extract the distance, inverse distance and inverse distance squared from each monitoring site to the nearest major road.

1.  **Set Variable Name**
    -   In the box next to Variable Name type a name for the variable to be created, e.g. majorRdDist, then click Enter.
2.  **Set Method**
    -   In the box next to Data to be extracted tick Distance, Inverse distance and Inverse distance squared, then click Select.
3.  **Set Input Data**
    -   From the dropdown menu next to Line Feature Class select OSM\_MajorRoads.
4.  **Set Direction of Effect**
    -   The further away a monitoring site is from a road the less it will be influenced by emissions from traffic on the road. This means as distance increases, pollution levels will decrease; therefore, you should set the direction of effect of the Distance variable to Negative. The inverse distance is 1 divided by the distance, while the inverse distance squared is 1 divided by the squared distance. This means as the distance becomes larger the inverse distance and inverse distance squared become smaller and so do the pollution levels. Therefore, you should set the direction for the Inverse distance and Inverse distance squared variables to Positive, then click Done. It is usually not necessary to use both the Distance and the Inverse distance, as they are functions of each other. However, for the purpose of this tutorial both are included to illustrate the fact that they have opposite directions of effects.

The completed page should look like this:

<img src="Images\Example_P3E.png" style="border:1px; border-style:solid; border-color:#8c8c8c;" />

Click Next &gt; to continue. The Predictors page will open again.

Click the Add button next to F. Distance to and/or Value of nearest Point.

### Distance to and/or value of nearest Point

Through this page you will create potential predictor variables that show the distance from each monitoring site to the nearest point, or the value of the nearest point or a combination of the distance and the value. For this tutorial you will extract the emission rate\*inverse distance and the emission rate\*inverse distance squared from each monitoring site to the nearest point source of NOx.

1.  **Set Variable Name**
    -   In the box next to Variable Name type a name for the variable to be created, e.g. EmPoint, then click Enter.
2.  **Set Method**
    -   In the box next to Data to be extracted tick Value \* Inverse distance and Value \* Inverse distance squared, then click Select.
3.  **Set Input Data**
    -   From the dropdown menu next to Point Feature Class select NOxEmissionPointSources.
    -   In the box next to Value Field(s) tick Emission, then click Select.
4.  **Set Direction of Effect**
    -   As illustrated above when using the inverse distance and inverse distance squared the value of the predictor variable changes in the same direction as does the pollution levels; therefore, the direction of effect for both variables should be set to Positive. Click Done.

The completed page should look like this:

<img src="Images\Example_P3F.png" style="border:1px; border-style:solid; border-color:#8c8c8c;" />

Click Next &gt; to continue. The Predictors page will open again.

Click the Add button next to G. Value of Raster cell.

### Value of Raster cell

Through this page you will create potential predictor variables that show the value of the raster cell that each monitoring site location spatially coincident with. For this you will use NOx emission rates aggregated at an area level in raster format. This should yield the same result as the analysis of the value of the nearest polygon that you used earlier.

1.  **Set Variable Name**
    -   In the box next to Variable Name type a name for the variable to be created, e.g. EmAreaRaster, then click Enter.
2.  **Set Input Data**
    -   From the dropdown menu next to Raster file select TotalNOxEmissionsAsNO2\_Raster.
    -   In the box next to Value Field(s) tick Emission, then click Select.
3.  **Set Direction of Effect**
    -   Set the direction of effect to Positive, then click Done.

The completed page should look like this:

<img src="Images\Example_P3G.png" style="border:1px; border-style:solid; border-color:#8c8c8c;" />

Click Next &gt; to continue. The Predictors page will open again. You can scroll through the list under Predictors Added to check that you have added all potential predictors that you would like to analyse.

Click Next &gt;.

Model
-----

This is the final page of the Build LUR wizard. On this page you need to choose the type of model that you would like to build, before you finally build the model.

1.  **Export data (optional)**
    -   Click the Export button. This will save the dependent variable and potential predictor variables in text file. This file is formatted so that it can be read by most statistical software, which allows users with statistical expertise to run their own analyses on the data.
2.  **Build LUR model**

-   Under Type of model you can choose between building a classic model or a hybrid model. For the purpose of this tutorial select Classic LUR. For further information on the difference between classic and hybrid models click the help button.
-   Click Build model. Depending on the amount of data entered building the model may take several minutes.

The completed page should look like this:

<img src="Images\Example_P4.png" style="border:1px; border-style:solid; border-color:#8c8c8c;" />

Click Finish.

Go to the directory of your output folder. Inside this folder you should see a new folder with the project name that you chose on the Settings page followed by a date and time stamp. Inside this new folder are the databases and files created by Build LUR:

<img src="Images\Example_outputfolder.png" style="border:1px; border-style:solid; border-color:#8c8c8c;" />

Open the lur\_var\_data\_\[Date\_Time\].csv file. This is the text file that you exported on the Model page, which contains the dependent variable and all potential predictor variables. Scroll to the right and find the pD\_EmissionAreaVal\_NOxEmission\_val variable and the pG\_EmAreaRaster\_raster\_val variable. The values of these two variables are identical, which confirms that the value of nearest polygon and value of raster cell methods produced the same result when run on the same data.

Open the LOG\_\[Date\_Time\].txt file. This text file records all entries made into the Build LUR wizard, any warning or error messages, and the model development process. Scroll through this file until you find Predictor variables created. This lists all of the variables created through the Predictors pages of the wizard. You may notice that some variables are missing, e.g. pA\_landuseArea\_Port\_100\_sum is not there even though a buffer distance of 100 was specified for all land use categories. The missing variable is due to the fact that no Port land use area was found within any of the 100m buffers around the monitoring sites. Similarly, pC\_EmissionPoint\_Chemical\_1000\_sum, pC\_EmissionPoint\_Chemical\_500\_sum, pC\_EmissionPoint\_Chemical\_300\_sum, and pC\_EmissionPoint\_Chemical\_100\_sum are missing, because no point emission source from the chemical sector was present in the 1000m, 500m, 300m, or 100m buffers.

Scrolling down further through the file shows that a file of descriptive statistics was created in the output folder. This file shows the mean, median and variability of all dependent and predictor variables. In addition, a correlation matrix of all variables was created and stored in the output folder.

The next section shows details of the machine learning process used to develop the LUR model. PyLUR uses supervised stepwise forward linear regression based on the methodology used in the [ESCAPE study](http://www.escapeproject.eu/manuals/ESCAPE_Exposure-manualv9.pdf) . PyLUR records the starting model, all intermediate models including reasons for their acceptance or rejection, and the final model. For the final model PyLUR will also record the variance inflation factors, case summaries, DF Betas, and the spatial autocorrelation of the residuals.

PyLUR will also carry out a leave one out cross validation of the final model, the results of which are shown in the LOOCV\_\[dependent variable name\]\_\[Date\_Time\].pdf file.

The next step is to apply the LUR model created with the Build LUR wizard to unmeasured points within the study area.

1.  Go back to ArcGIS Pro.
2.  In the Catalog window double-click the BuildLUR script.
3.  In the Geoprocessing window on the right click Run. This will open the Apply LUR wizard.

Settings
--------

Similar to the Build LUR wizard you need to specify some general settings on this page.

1.  **Set Output Name**
    -   Next to Output Name type a suitable name for application output (e.g. LURApply) and click Enter.
2.  **Set Data Sources**
    -   Click the Browse button next to LUR File Geodatabase. Navigate to the output directory that you used in the Build LUR wizard. In this directory select the MyFirstLUR\_\[Date\_Time\].gdb file geodatabase.
    -   Click the Browse button next to LUR SQLite Database. Navigate to the output directory that you used in the Build LUR wizard. In this directory select the LurSqlDB.sqlite database.
3.  **Set Model**
    -   In the box next to Select LUR Model(s) tick MODEL\_depNO2, then click Select.

The completed page should look like this:

<img src="Images\Example_AppP1.png" style="border:1px; border-style:solid; border-color:#8c8c8c;" />

Click Next&gt; to continue.

Receptors
---------

To apply the LUR model to unmeasured locations within your study area you need to provide a number of receptor points. This page provides you with three options to do this: you can provide an existing point feature class, you can create regularly spaced points within your study area, or you can create a number of random points within your study area. For the purpose of this tutorial select B.Regular Points.

### Receptors from Regular Points

On this page you need to specify the horizontal and vertical distance between points. The unit of the distance is the map unit of the projected coordinate system specified in the Build LUR wizard, which in this case is metres.

1.  **Set Distances**
    -   In the box next to Horizontal Distance type 1000, then click Enter.
    -   In the box next to Vertical Distance type 1000, then click Enter.

The completed page should look like this:

<img src="Images\Example_AppP2B.png" style="border:1px; border-style:solid; border-color:#8c8c8c;" />

Click Next&gt; to continue.

Apply Model
-----------

This is the final page of the Apply LUR wizard.

1.  **Apply LUR Model**
    -   Click the Apply model button. Depending on the number of receptor points entered and the complexity of the model this may take a while.

The completed page should look like this:

<img src="Images\Example_AppP3.png" style="border:1px; border-style:solid; border-color:#8c8c8c;" />

Click Finish to close the Apply LUR wizard.

Go to the directory of your output folder. Inside your MyFirstLUR\_\[Date\_Time\] folder you should see a new folder called LURApply\_\[DateTime\]. Go inside this new folder. You should see two databases and two text files:

<img src="Images\Example_applyfolder.png" style="border:1px; border-style:solid; border-color:#8c8c8c;" />

Open the Apply\_Log.txt file. Similar to the Build LUR wizard this text file records all entries made into the Apply LUR wizard. In addition, it indicates the time it took to extract values for each predictor variable and to calculate predicted values.

To view the predicted values calculated by the Apply LUR wizard:

1.  In ArcGIS Pro insert a new map.
2.  Click on Add Data and navigate to the LURApply\_\[Date\_Time\] folder.
3.  Open the LURApply.gdb file geodatabase, then open the LURdata feature dataset and select LURApply\_receptors.
4.  In the Appearance menu click on Symbology and select the Graduated Colors option.
5.  In the Symbology pane on the right select predNO2 in the dropdown list next to Field.
6.  Select Quantile in the dropdown list next to Method.
7.  Choose a suitable number for Classes (e.g. 5) and a suitable Color scheme (e.g. Blue to Red).

You should see something similar to this:

<img src="Images\Example_applymap.png" style="border:1px; border-style:solid; border-color:#8c8c8c;" />
